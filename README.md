# Android Chat App ðŸ“±

## Introduction
I created this chat application to practice my Flutter knowledge and to learn more about Firebase. The application is fully functional and there is currently only 1 common chat room where every member can send and receive messages.

This is the Signup Screen where users can signup with their email address, username and password. They also have to add a picture and this picture will be visible to everyone in the chat room. It will be located on top of their messages. They can add an image from their phone or they can take one during the signup by tapping on the empty avatar area.
